# Politics
## Intro

This project is using an API from the Federal Elections Commission to gather data about politicians. The website, for the API, may be found here: https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/#!/candidate/get_candidates_search. Having a political science and history background further drew me to using the FEC API. Let's see how this turns out!
